# Horus 2.0: A-1 Fence Cost Estimator

## Overview

The A-1 Fence Cost Estimator is a Python-based tool developed to provide a comprehensive solution for calculating the total cost of a 1 km fencing project. The program considers various components, their weights, costs, and quantities, allowing for customized options based on user input.

## Key Features

- **Component Database**: Stores details such as component name, weight, price, and quantity.
- **Customization Options**: Allows users to select from various coating types, security options, colors, and accessories.
- **Cost Calculation**: Computes the required quantities, weights, and costs of components, as well as labor and additional features.
- **Detailed Output**: Provides a breakdown of total costs, including materials, labor, and customization.

## Input Parameters

The program accepts the following input parameters:
- Length of the fence (fixed at 1 km for this version)
- User-selected customization options (e.g., coating type, security features, color, accessories)

## Calculation Logic

1. **Component Quantity**: Calculates the number of fence posts, base plates, anchor plates, clamps, and weld mesh panels required.
2. **Material Costs and Weight**: Computes the total weight and price of each component based on the user's selections and market conditions.
3. **Labor Costs**: Calculates installation labor costs based on the size, difficulty, and location of the project.
4. **Additional Costs**: Includes costs for security features, coatings, and other relevant customization options.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- Material prices and labor rates are subject to change based on market conditions and location.
- The program currently supports basic customization options; more advanced features may be added in future versions.
- The program has been tested with various input values to ensure accuracy, but real-world variations may occur.
